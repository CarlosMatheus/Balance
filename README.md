# Balance

Balance is a simple and challenge arcade game made using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).  
One of the purposes of this game is to develop a simple engine for making easier the use of Pygame to build more complex games.  
This engine includes support for collisions, meshes, materials, game objects and scenes.  
The elements used are very similar to the ones used in the engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity Official Website").

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine if you use Linux. 
Instructions for Windows and Mac are similar.

### Prerequisites

You will just have to install Pygame. The instructions below will show you how to do this for Linux (Ubuntu 16.04).

First, install Python3 setup tools and pip:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
$ sudo easy_install3 pip
```

Then install Pygame using pip:

```
$ sudo pip3.5 install pygame
```

### Playing the game

To run the game, go to the directory where you cloned the repository and simply run the following:

```
$ python3 balance.py
```

## About

This project aims to create a game engine to make easier the precess of game development using Pygame. Therefore, the main frame of the game is flexible and can be adapted to multiple types of games.
To understand a little bit more about how the code is structured visit the [wiki](https://github.com/CarlosMatheus/Balance/wiki).

The objective of Balance is to get the most amount of points as possible. A hard task to the game is getting to score equal to 1000 and it should be the main goal of the game.
This game is an example of the capabilities of the game structure.
