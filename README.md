## About

The objective of Balance is to get the most amount of points as possible. A hard task to the game is getting a score equal to 1000, and that should be the main goal of the game. This game is an example of the capabilities of the pygin game engine.

One of the initial purposes of this game was to develop a simple engine to simplify the use of Pygame to build more complex games. Therefore, the main frame of the game was built to be flexible and could be adapted to multiple types of games.
Balance and Pygin were born together in this repository, but then the engine grew and migrated to its own [repository](https://github.com/CarlosMatheus/Pygin).
