# Balance
Mobile game inspired on Duet


Infinity shooter is a fun and simple game made using Pygame. It was made as part of ITA's (Teachnological Institute of Aeronautics) discipline CES-22. The purpose of the game is to illustrate the use of POO in a real project as well as develop a simple structure for making easier the use of Pygame. This structure includes support for collisions, meshes, materials etc. The elements used are very similar to the elements used in the engine Unity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine if you use Linux. Instructions for Windows and Mac are similar.

### Prerequisites

You will just have to install Pygame. The instructions below will show you how to do this for Linux (Unbuntu 16.04).

First, install Python3 setup tools and pip:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
$ sudo easy_install3 pip
```

Then install Pygame (it uses Python3 as main programming language):

```
$ sudo pip3.5 install pygame
```

### Playing the game

To run the game simply run the game Python script using Python3:

```
$ python3 InfinityShooter.py
```

## Built With

* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - Pyhton3 game library used in this game

## Contributing

Please read [the contributing document](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the inner working of the code to help us make a better game.

## About

This project aims to create a code base to make easier the precess of game development using Pygame. Therefore, the main frame of the game is flexible and can be addapted to multiple types of games.
To understand a little bit more about how the code is structered visit the [wiki](https://github.com/aloysiogl/PygameAloysioAndreSebastiao/wiki/Home).

The objective of infinity shooter is to destroy the enemy and avoid obstacles. This game is an exaple of the capabilities of the game structure.
